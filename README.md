# 💳 Credit Risk Scoring Using Machine Learning

This project builds a predictive model to evaluate the likelihood of loan default based on customer attributes. It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to credit risk assessment, enabling lenders to make data-driven decisions.

---

## ✅ Objective

To build a credit scoring model that helps predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan using historical customer data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in default behavior.
- Engineered and scaled features to improve model performance.
- Trained and compared multiple ML models for credit default prediction.
- Evaluated results using classification metrics and visualizations.
- Generated insights to support credit approval decisions.
